I saw Golang article and I immidiately thought to myself, 
"Wow, a programming language that is close to C but with much simpler syntax, faster than Python, created by Google, can be used in websites,
I gotta learn this!" 

So, here I am. These projects ideas come from the challenge portion from CodeAcademy.
